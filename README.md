# Exercism - Coding exercises using TDD

* These challenges are completed using a test driven development approach
* After downloading each challenge, the first thing to do is to run the test file
* By reading the error message, we know what we must do to fix the problem.
* We then get a new error. Repeat.
* Through this process, errors become failures, failures become passes.
* On to the next test and start again!
* Eventually we have designed an MVP which will satisfy all test cases

## Testing

Tests are run using the minitest test suite.

## Gemfile
source "https://rubygems.org"
